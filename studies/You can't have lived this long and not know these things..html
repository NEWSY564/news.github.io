    <p><b>You can't have lived this long and not know these things. </b></p>
    <p>- If you don't know these things you may be too naive and uninformed to
      survive in the world:</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>- Every televised awards show is decided in advance via bribes and payola
      by the agents for the nominees. Nothing you see on a TV awards show is a
      true reflection of any kind of legitimate voting by any representation of
      the public. </p>
    <p>- Hollywood and Silicon Valley are run by perverts, as the lawsuits and
      scandals in the news every week prove. They engage in sex cults, worker
      sexploitation and transaction-sex because they can get away with it.</p>
    <p>- Banking industry promotions and brain chemicals force you to want
      babies.</p>
    <p>- Corporations hire people based on whether they "look" like the others
      there and not based on their skills.</p>
    <p>- Millionaires have hundreds of service companies to hire in order to
      place hit-jobs and character assassinations on competitors and reporters.
      Companies like Kroll, Fusion GPS, PSOP, Black Cube, Gizmodo, Shareblue,
      Podesta Group can easily end your life for a small fee.</p>
    <p>- People using dating sites make 90% of their YES/NO decision based on
      your facial symmetry and bone structure in your face and 99% of a person's
      decision to date you is based on subconscious brain process that almost
      nobody is aware of.</p>
    <p>- When you have sex, chemicals like Oxytocin, in your brain, program you
      to do things, for up to a month afterwards, that you would never normally
      do. Brain chemicals can re-program your way of thinking.</p>
    <p>- Every "certified" rating service accepts bribes. Amazon "reviews", Yelp
      "reviews", "Diamond certified", Kelly Blue Book reviews, JD Powell Car
      Ratings, Consumer Reports, NY Times Book Ratings, Billboard Charts,
      Facebook "likes", Angies, All car rating services, etc, all have covert
      means to bribe their writers, editors and reviewers.</p>
    <p>- Your elected officials are being bribed.They are bribed with: Billions
      of dollars of Google, Twitter, Facebook, Tesla, Netflix and Sony Pictures
      search engine rigging and shadow-banning which is never reported to the
      FEC; Free rent; Male and female prostitutes; Cars; Dinners; Party
      Financing; Sports Event Tickets; Political campaign printing and mailing
      services "Donations"; Secret PAC Financing; Jobs in Corporations in
      Silicon Valley For The Family Members of Those Who Take Bribes And Those
      Who Take Bribes; "Consulting" contracts from McKinsey as fronted pay-off
      gigs; Overpriced "Speaking Engagements" which are really just pay-offs
      conduited for donors; Private jet rides and use of Government fuel depots
      (ie: Google handed out NASA jet fuel to staff); Real Estate; Fake
      mortgages; The use of Cayman, Boca Des Tores, Swiss and related
      money-laundering accounts; The use of HSBC, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and
      Deustche Bank money laundering accounts and covert stock accounts; Free
      spam and bulk mailing services owned by Silicon Valley corporations; Use
      of high tech law firms such as Perkins Coie, Wilson Sonsini, MoFo,
      Covington &amp; Burling, etc. to conduit bribes to officials; and other
      means now documented by us, The FBI, the FTC, The SEC, The FEC and
      journalists.</p>
    <p>- The NSA records everything that is said on, or near, every electronic
      device and stores it for up to ten years. Your surveillance records are
      constantly scanned for thousands of 'red flag' words that you might utter
      and if you say one of these things, the surveillance on you is tripled,
      for life.</p>
    <p>- The "Executive Producers" listed on all TV and Movie productions decide
      which subliminal social justice messages they want to embed in your
      entertainment media. Call them out in social media when they try to
      manipulate your ideology.</p>
    <p>- Cures for AIDS, Cancer, Alzheimer's, Aging and other deadly diseases
      are working now in small university tests but politics, profiteering and
      bureaucracy are delaying them from getting to retail.</p>
    <p>- Online dating can never work because it reduces men to just sex
      -searching and women to just high-income man searching and makes 2D images
      the facade for 3D people with decades of life experiences. 70% of online
      profiles are fake postings by organized off-shore scammer groups.</p>
    <p>- You don't "NEED" a house. Bankers, realty groups and construction
      cartels make you think you need one in order to profit off your debt and
      fear of homelessness. Renting is the best value in a post-2008 world.</p>
    <p>- Having children means you will never date, go out to a show, easily
      travel or own anything that isn't broken for the best years of your life.</p>
    <p>- Google and Facebook DO spy on everything you do, analyze you,
      manipulate you and sell your info to political organizations.</p>
    <p>- "Co-working spaces" are designed to sucker naive college kids, who are
      addicted to Frat House culture, and can't live without&nbsp; an
      echo-chamber. Such spaces rarely generate anything useful.</p>
    <p>- You can get all of the TV and Movies you want for less than $9.00 per
      month. Only idiots pay cable and media services $60.00+ per month for what
      everybody else gets for free or only a few bucks.</p>
    <p>- Linux software computers are the most secure, have an interface exactly
      like MAC or Microsoft and all of the software is free. Only idiots that
      are too afraid of getting off their leash use the other software.</p>
    <p>- Every public camera shares its database with every other public camera
      and any large organization can watch you from camera to camera. So can a
      stalker, a foreign hacker or your ex-spouse.</p>
    <p>- If you can't remove the battery from your phone, tablet or computer
      then the device can be monitoring you. The people who think they are not
      worth being surveilled are usually the ones being surveilled by large
      scanning organizations because uniformed people are the easiest to
      exploit.</p>
    <p>- There are over a million books, news reports and Congressional
      investigations proving that everything on this list is true but people
      with a sheep-like disposition are afraid of the truth and like to exist in
      their bubble of fantasy. Those kinds of people eventually have a nervous
      break-down.</p>
    <p>- Bippity-bop 'happy-go-luck'y people that have lived a sheltered life
      usually crash the hardest, eventually.</p>
    <p>- Scopalomine and other drugs can be sprayed in a mist in front of you.
      When you are under the effect of these "Devil's Breath" drugs you will do
      anything you are told including robbery, gang rape participation and
      murder. Scopalomine is the #1 date rape drug in New York City and Silicon
      Valley.</p>
    <p>- 10,000 years of cultural programming, since birth, in each generation,
      by any religious population cannot be changed unless you eliminate the
      institutions that teach it and no culture will do that.</p>
    <p>- England invaded (colonially took over) Pakistan and India and now they
      have come back and taken over England as quid-pro-quo</p>
    <p>- The stock market moves hundreds of trillions of dollars around, mostly
      to the 1%. What extremes do you think a 1%-er would go to to keep getting
      their private sex islands, jets, penthouse parties and controlling
      governments?</p>
    <p>- Men will never stop being fixated on breasts because it is built into
      their genetic memory.</p>
    <p>- Racial intolerance will never end because it is built into the cultural
      memory of humans.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">- Your politicians are
      competing with your business and your job. You will usually find that the
      government bosses looking at your government filing are often hand-picked
      by your business adversaries. You will rarely find a single entity in
      government appeal for reviews or determinations who was not either:
      financed by, friends, with, sleeping with, dating the staff of, holding
      stock market assets in, promised a revolving door job or government
      service contracts from, partying with, personal friends with, photographed
      at private events with, exchanging emails with, business associates of or
      directed by; one of those business adversaries, or the Senators and
      politicians that those business adversaries pay campaign finances to, or
      supply political digital services to. Never trust a politician because
      they make most of their money from stock market perks they get from
      rigging political decisions.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">- In most major cities, hot
      girls have more sex than porn stars. Hot girls have thousands of men
      solicit them per week and porn stars only have agents book 3 to 4 sex acts
      per week. Porn stars equate sex with work and repetition and hot girls
      just do it for fun and free dinners.</p>
