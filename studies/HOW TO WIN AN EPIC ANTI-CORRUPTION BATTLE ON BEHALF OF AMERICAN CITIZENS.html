    <p><b>HOW TO WIN AN EPIC ANTI-CORRUPTION BATTLE ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN
        CITIZENS</b></p>
    <br>
    <p><br>
      A group of domestic citizens filed FBI complaints and lawsuits against
      White House and government agency senior staff and their Silicon Valley
      oligarch financiers including a lawsuit against a rogue, dirty tricks,
      off-shoot of the CIA called "In-Q-Tel". <br>
      <br>
      These citizens instigated Congressional corruption investigations and
      hearings against the most senior members of the State and Federal
      government. These actions resulted in the termination of very famous
      public officials including the Secretary of Energy, his staff, White House
      Executives and more. The case broke-up some of their crony criminal
      embezzlement scams. It nearly resulted in the President being forced to
      leave office, mid-term, based on revelations of a massive crony stock
      market kick-back scheme which began to be exposed after the FBI raid of
      Solyndra. The director of the FBI was fired for assisting in cover-ups
      related to this matter because the matter was reported directly to him. <br>
      <br>
      This natural-born, American, domestic group of engineers was attacked with
      a $30 million dollar+ (per uncovered billing notices)
      retribution/political reprisal program contracted by White House political
      operatives, and their appointees, who were also the business competitors
      of the engineers. <br>
      <br>
      The attackers used Fusion GPS-type character assassination smear campaigns
      (operated by their cronies at Google, Gawker, Gizmodo, Jalopnik and
      Facebook), NVCA black-listing, Solyndra-laundering, stone-walling, Lois
      Lerner-class agency manipulation and search engine rigging. In-Q-Tel turns
      out to be the only federally financed "charity" whose staff are also
      employed by each of the suspects in this case and who financed the
      suspects in this case. It was revealed that White House executives ordered
      government agencies to harm members of the public and to reprisal
      with-hold public resources from the public. This was a violation of tort,
      RICO and anti-trust laws.<br>
      <br>
      The citizens had previously been awarded federal commendations, state and
      federal innovation grants, government R&amp;D contracts and knew White
      House and Congressional executives personally. They know "where the bodies
      are buried".<br>
      <br>
      The citizen-victims fought back. <br>
      <br>
      With the encouragement of members of Congress they used 100% legal tools
      to interdict the corruption.<br>
      <br>
      Essentially; they helped the United States government sue itself!<br>
      <br>
      First, with a unique new kind of pioneering federal lawsuit, victims
      established — FOR THE FIRST TIME IN LEGAL HISTORY — that political
      cronyism is a valid basis for a claim of arbitrary-and-capricious agency
      action under the Administrative Procedure Act. See: Federal Case One,
      (D.D.C. 2015).<br>
      <br>
      Second, they prevailed in the United States Court of Appeals for the
      District of Columbia Circuit on their appeal of the district court’s
      ruling that an agency may escape judicial review of its action by
      requesting a voluntary remand but refusing to reconsider its initial
      denial of an application. See: Case Federal Two, (D.C. Cir. 2017). The
      Washington DC Circuit agreed with the victims that an agency may only seek
      a remand if it promises to reconsider its initial decision. It is because
      of that victory that the government, under court order is now re-doing the
      victims applications and GAO, FBI, IG's and Congressional oversight
      offices are watching to assure effective ethics and transparency.<br>
      <br>
      Third, these cases placed, on permanent public record, one of the most
      detailed documentation sets, ever assembled, about how modern political
      "Dark Money" conduits operate. The legal team hired ex-FBI, CIA and SEC
      experts to track down covert bank accounts, revolving door bribes, insider
      stock trades and other payola between the victim's competitors and public
      officials. This documentation now prevents the use of those kinds of
      criminal efforts, in the future, by exposing their tactics to the public.<br>
      <br>
      Fourth, the victim's team engaged in the interdiction and termination of
      corrupt agency executives, contractors and their financiers. This included
      some of the most well-known names in Washington, DC, at the time. Many of
      them were, and are still being, investigated and surveilled by the FBI,
      GAO, SEC and Congress.<br>
      <br>
      Fifth, and most important, the effort put every corrupt political scheme
      on notice that they WILL be found out and interdicted!<br>
      <br>
      The bottom line? <br>
      <br>
      The victims group WON on every single aspect of their public-interest
      goals but still have yet to be recompensed for their damages! They
      continue to fight for their Constitutional rights and the payment of their
      damages and benefits fro the government.<br>
      <br>
      They have won over and over while the opposition keeps getting fired,
      arrested, investigated and exposed in national news documentaries!<br>
      <br>
      Now the "bad guys" have less options to engage in the corruption of our
      Democracy!<br>
      <br>
      <i><b>You're Welcome, America!</b></i><br>
      <br>
      These co-workers witnessed politicians and Silicon Valley oligarchs
      (sometimes called "The Deep State") stealing money from both: 1.) Their
      company and 2.) the US Government Treasury and handing it to Elon Musk and
      their other insider friends. They reported it to the authorities. <br>
      <br>
      The crime turned out to be part of one of the biggest embezzlement crimes
      ever exposed. Major political figures and tech "bosses" turned out to be
      running a "PayPal Tech Mafia". The bad guys then began hunting them down
      and attacking them in reprisal "for the rest of our lives" per their
      threats and their ongoing retribution vendettas.<br>
      <br>
      It was found that famous senators, their Silicon Valley oligarch
      financiers and their associates run an organized crime insider trading
      scam that abuses taxpayers and sabotages competing businesses. The
      terminations of the heads of the FBI, The Department of Energy and other
      famous people in politics is because of their operation, and cover-ups, of
      this case. The cover-ups are still going on. The Wenstein, Epstein and
      related cases show, though, that cover-ups never last.<br>
      <br>
      Now, over 300 million potential voters can "crowd-source" join the
      forensic efforts to expose, shame, dox, bankrupt, boycott and 100% legally
      exterminate the corrupt entities who did these illicit things by using our
      Democracy as their billionaire's plaything.<br>
      <br>
      Hundreds of the perpetrators have already been fired, placed under
      permanent public surveillance, financially tracked through every asset,
      reported to federal agencies and targeted for investigation. The goal is
      to interdict every single person, company and political operative group
      who is engaging in these crimes using crowd-sourced investigation and
      intelligence tools.<br>
      <br>
      This is a large part of all of that "political corruption" and "dirty Dark
      Money" politics you read about in the newspaper every day.<br>
      <br>
      If you thought that Mossack Fonseca and the Panama Papers was "The Story":
      IT WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING! <br>
      <br>
      A key part of one of the testimony statements reads: <i>"...SILICON
        VALLEY'S POLITICIANS MAKE POLICY THAT, BOTH, RUINS TAXPAYERS WHILE
        MAKING THE POLITICIANS RICH BY ARTIFICIALLY INFLATING THE VALUE OF THE
        POLITICIANS SECRET STOCK MARKET HOLDINGS. NOW WE ARE EXPOSING THEIR
        ENTIRE SCAM!<br>
        <br>
        THIS IS ABOUT THE U.S. SENATORS AND THEIR CRONY DARK MONEY POLITICAL
        BRIBES AND CRIMINAL KICK-BACKS, THE TECH OLIGARCHS WHO DEPLOYED THE
        BRIBES AND THE VICTIMS OF THESE CRIMES.<br>
        <br>
        IMAGINE LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THE PUBLIC OFFICIALS
        THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU TURNED OUT TO BE YOUR BUSINESS
        COMPETITORS. IMAGINE HAVING THEM USE GOVERNMENT RESOURCES TO PROFIT AT
        YOUR EXPENSE, BLOCKADE YOU AND TREAT DEMOCRACY LIKE A GARAGE SALE! THIS
        IS THAT STORY!..."</i><br>
      <br>
      Google, Tesla, Facebook, Linkedin and their VC's (and deeply bribed
      Senators) operated hit-jobs on the public and their competitors, supported
      by the Obama White House and U.S. Dept. of Energy. <br>
      <br>
      This is about a group of tech oligarchs, and their corrupt Senators, who
      commit crimes in order to manipulate over a trillion tax dollars (YOUR
      MONEY) into their, and their friends pockets.<br>
      <br>
      They are felons yet they control some of the offices of the agencies who
      are supposed to arrest them. Silicon Valley bought K Street and U.S.
      Senators, gave them more Dark Money than history has ever seen and then
      had giant tech-law firms bribe, hit-job and blockade any attempts to solve
      the problem.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the largest bribes in American history were paid via billions of
      dollars of pre-IPO cleantech stock, insider trading, real estate, Google
      search engine rigging and shadow-banning, sex workers, revolving door
      jobs, nepotism, state-supported black-listing of competitors and
      under-the-table cash. Why are these Silicon Valley Oligarchs and their
      K-Street law firms and lobbyists immune from the law?<br>
      <br>
      <b><u>U.S. Senators, Agency Heads and Congress were bribed with:</u></b><br>
      <br>
      - Billions of dollars of Google, Twitter, Facebook, Tesla, Netflix and
      Sony Pictures stock and stock warrants which is never reported to the FEC<br>
      <br>
      - Billions of dollars of Google, Twitter, Facebook, Tesla, Netflix and
      Sony Pictures search engine rigging including shadow-banning, de-boosting,
      DNS re-routing, directed search suggestion, subliminal messaging bias, and
      hundreds of other psychological manipulation tricks; the value of which is
      never reported to the FEC but proven by invoices and bank payments between
      Google and Gawker, Gizmodo, DNC, Fusion GPS, Black Cube, etc.<br>
      <br>
      - Free rent<br>
      <br>
      - Prostitutes and Rent Boys<br>
      <br>
      - Cars<br>
      <br>
      - Dinners<br>
      <br>
      - Party Financing<br>
      <br>
      - Sports Event Tickets<br>
      <br>
      - Campaign Services "Donations"<br>
      <br>
      - Secret PAC Financing<br>
      <br>
      - Jobs in Corporations in Silicon Valley For The Family Members of Those
      Who Take Bribes And Those Who Take Bribes, Themselves<br>
      <br>
      - "Consulting" contracts from McKinsey as fronted pay-off gigs<br>
      <br>
      - Overpriced "Speaking Engagements" which are really just pay-offs
      conduited for donors<br>
      <br>
      - Private jet rides and use of Government fuel depots (ie: Google handed
      out NASA jet fuel to staff)<br>
      <br>
      - Real Estate<br>
      <br>
      - The use of Cayman, Boca Des Tores, Swiss and related laundering accounts<br>
      <br>
      - The use of HSBC, Wells Fargo and Deustche Bank money laundering accounts<br>
      <br>
      - Free spam and bulk mailing services owned by corporations<br>
      <br>
      - Use of high tech law firms such as Perkins Coie, Wilson Sonsini, MoFo,
      Covington &amp; Burling, etc. to conduit bribes to officials</p>
    <p>Investigators were able to get a law produced that made insider trading
      less attractive for Congress, nothing has been done to stop stock warrant
      bribes and revolving door payola. Additionally, even with the new law, 60%
      of the U.S. Congress (including their associates and families) STILL
      engage in insider trading because law enforcement has not prosecuted many
      of them.<br>
      <br>
      This is about a group of U.S. Senators, Silicon Valley Oligarchs, Crooked
      Law Firms and Lobbyists who commit crimes in order to manipulate over a
      trillion tax dollars into their, and their friends pockets. They use media
      monopoly tricks to try to shut out any other viewpoints. They push pretend
      issues that they believe will get more tax money allocated to "issue
      solutions" that they, and their friends, happen to already own the
      monopolies for. They are felons yet they control some of the offices of
      the agencies who are supposed to arrest them. Silicon Valley bought K
      Street lobby firms and U.S. Senators, gave them more Dark Money than
      history has ever seen and then had giant tech-law firms bribe, hit-job and
      blockade any attempts to arrest them.<br>

      Said one victim: <i>"They had the U.S. Government hire us, paid us part
        of our money, then asked us to spend our life savings and years of our
        time on their federal project based on their lies and false-promises.
        Then they took the assets we were asked to invest, plus the money they
        owed us, and gave it to their friends. When we complained to the FBI,
        Congress and the SEC, they hired Fusion GPS-like companies to run
        "hit-jobs" on us and threaten our lives. WE WERE LIED TO AND DEFRAUDED
        BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. THEY TOOK OUR MONEY AND USED US, AND OUR PEERS,
        AS A SMOKE-SCREEN TO HIDE THEIR CRONY PAYOLA CRIME THAT PUT TAXPAYER

      Years of archived news videos provide evidence, by thousands of reporters
      and investigators, that the suspects are: A.) Based around Silicon Valley
      and Washington DC; B.) Operating as a RICO-violating cartel; C.) Deeply
      sociopath and sexually disturbed; D.) Money laundering via large law firms
      and investment banks; E.) Using Google, Reddit, Facebook, etc. as mass
      political behavior-manipulation programs; F.) Paying for and operating
      character assassination programs against those who defy them; G.) Using
      "green energy" as one of their facades to steer tax dollars to the
      companies that they, and their friends, already own and work for; H.)
      Willing to resort to the most extreme things to protect their scheme; I).
      Living in an ideological "echo-chamber" in their tech bubbles; J.)
      Empowered entirely by the public's lack of willingness to boycott them and
      demand their arrests.<br>

      A vast number of individuals and companies, who are willing to testify
      about these crimes have NEVER BEEN ALLOWED into a Congressional hearing,

      terrified of the confirming testimony they can all provide.<br>

      company bosses in Palo Alto, their National Venture Capital Association
      (NVCA) partners and the tech companies (Google, Tesla, Facebook, Amazon,

      The Deep State. They have purchased California, New York and Washington,
      DC politicians (mostly Senators) who they also control.<br>

      Authorities in the UK have finally figured out that fake news stories and
      Russian-placed ads are not the real problem. The UK Parliament is about to
      impose stiff penalties—not on the people who place the ads or write the
      stories, but on the Big Tech platforms that determine which ads and
      stories people actually see.<br>
      <br>
      Parliament’s plans will almost surely be energized by the latest leak of
      damning material from inside Google’s fortress of secrecy: The Wall Street
      Journal recently reported on emails exchanged among Google employees in
      January 2017 in which they strategized about how to alter Google search
      results and other “ephemeral experiences” to counter President Donald
      Trump’s newly imposed travel ban. The company claims that none of these
      plans was ever implemented, but who knows?<br>
      <br>
      While U.S. authorities have merely held hearings, EU authorities have
      taken dramatic steps in recent years to limit the powers of Big Tech, most
      recently with a comprehensive law that protects user privacy—the General
      Data Protection Regulation—and a whopping $5.1 billion fine against Google
      for monopolistic practices in the mobile device market. Last year, the
      European Union also levied a $2.7 billion fine against Google for
      filtering and ordering search results in a way that favored their own
      products and services. That filtering and ordering, it turns out, is of
      crucial importance.<br>
      <br>
      As years of research I’ve been conducting on online influence has shown,
      content per se is not the real threat these days; what really matters is
      (a) which content is selected for users to see, and (b) the way that
      content is ordered in search results, search suggestions, news feeds,
      message feeds, comment lists, and so on. That’s where the power lies to
      shift opinions, purchases, and votes, and that power is held by a
      disturbingly small group of people.<br>
      <br>
      I say “these days” because the explosive growth of a handful of massive
      platforms on the internet—the largest, by far, being Google and the next
      largest being Facebook—has changed everything. Millions of people and
      organizations are constantly trying to get their content in front of our
      eyes, but for more than 2.5 billion people around the world—soon to be
      more than 4 billion—the responsibility for what algorithms do should
      always lie with the people who wrote the algorithms and the companies that
      deployed them.<br>
      <br>
      In randomized, controlled, peer-reviewed research I’ve conducted with
      thousands of people, I’ve shown repeatedly that when people are undecided,
      I can shift their opinions on just about any topic just by changing how I
      filter and order the information I show them. I’ve also shown that when,
      in multiple searches, I show people more and more information that favors
      one candidate, I can shift opinions even farther. Even more disturbing, I
      can do these things in ways that are completely invisible to people and in
      ways that don’t leave paper trails for authorities to trace.<br>
      <br>
      Worse still, these new forms of influence often rely on ephemeral
      content—information that is generated on the fly by an algorithm and then
      disappears forever, which means that it would be difficult, if not
      impossible, for authorities to reconstruct. If, on Election Day this
      coming November, Mark Zuckerberg decides to broadcast go-out-and-vote
      reminders mainly to members of one political party, how would we be able
      to detect such a manipulation? If we can’t detect it, how would we be able
      to reduce its impact? And how, days or weeks later, would we be able to
      turn back the clock to see what happened?<br>
      <br>
      Of course, companies like Google and Facebook emphatically reject the idea
      that their search and newsfeed algorithms are being tweaked in ways that
      could meddle in elections. Doing so would undermine the public’s trust in
      their companies, spokespeople have said. They insist that their algorithms
      are complicated, constantly changing, and subject to the “organic”
      activity of users.<br>
      <br>
      This is, of course, sheer nonsense. Google can adjust its algorithms to
      favor any candidate it chooses no matter what the activity of users might
      be, just as easily as I do in my experiments. As legal scholar Frank
      Pasquale noted in his recent book “The Black Box Society,” blaming
      algorithms just doesn’t cut it; the responsibility for what an algorithm
      does should always lie with the people who wrote the algorithm and the
      companies that deployed the algorithm. Alan Murray, president of Fortune,
      recently framed the issue this way: “Rule one in the Age of AI: Humans
      remain accountable for decisions, even when made by machines.”<br>
      <br>
      Given that 95 percent of donations from Silicon Valley generally go to
      Democrats, it’s hard to imagine that the algorithms of companies like
      Facebook and Google don’t favor their favorite candidates. A newly leaked
      video of a 2016 meeting at Google shows without doubt that high-ranking
      Google executives share a strong political preference, which could easily
      be expressed in algorithms. The favoritism might be deliberately
      programmed or occur simply because of unconscious bias. Either way, votes
      and opinions shift.<br>
      <br>
      It’s also hard to imagine how, in any election in the world, with or
      without intention on the part of company employees, Google search results
      would fail to tilt toward one candidate. Google’s search algorithm
      certainly has no equal-time rule built into it; we wouldn’t want it to! We
      want it to tell us what’s best, and the algorithm will indeed always favor
      one dog food over another, one music service over another, and one
      political candidate over another. When the latter happens … votes and
      opinions shift.<br>
      <br>
      Here are 10 ways—seven of which I am actively studying and
      quantifying—that Big Tech companies could use to shift millions of votes
      this coming November with no one the wiser. Let’s hope, of course, that
      these methods are not being used and will never be used, but let’s be
      realistic too; there’s generally no limit to what people will do when
      money and power are on the line.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME)</b><br>
      Ongoing research I began in January 2013 has shown repeatedly that when
      one candidate is favored over another in search results, voting
      preferences among undecided voters shift dramatically—by 20 percent or
      more overall, and by up to 80 percent in some demographic groups. This is
      partly because people place inordinate trust in algorithmically generated
      output, thinking, mistakenly, that algorithms are inherently objective and
      impartial.<br>
      <br>
      But my research also suggests that we are conditioned to believe in
      high-ranking search results in much the same way that rats are conditioned
      to press levers in Skinner boxes. Because most searches are for simple
      facts (“When was Donald Trump born?”), and because correct answers to
      simple questions inevitably turn up in the first position, we are taught,
      day after day, that the higher a search result appears in the list, the
      more true it must be. When we finally search for information to help us
      make a tough decision (“Who’s better for the economy, Trump or Clinton?”),
      we tend to believe the information on the web pages to which high-ranking
      search results link.<br>
      <br>
      As The Washington Post reported last year, in 2016, I led a team that
      developed a system for monitoring the election-related search results
      Google, Bing, and Yahoo were showing users in the months leading up to the
      presidential election, and I found pro-Clinton bias in all 10 search
      positions on the first page of Google’s search results. Google responded,
      as usual, that it has “never re-ranked search results on any topic
      (including elections) to manipulate political sentiment”—but I never
      claimed it did. I found what I found, namely that Google’s search results
      favored Hillary Clinton; “re-ranking”—an obtuse term Google seems to have
      invented to confuse people—is irrelevant.<br>
      <br>
      Because (a) many elections are very close, (b) 90 percent of online
      searches in most countries are conducted on just one search engine
      (Google), and (c) internet penetration is high in most countries these
      days—higher in many countries than it is in the United States—it is
      possible that the outcomes ofupwards of 25 percent of the world’s national
      elections are now being determined by Google’s search algorithm, even
      without deliberate manipulation on the part of company employees. Because,
      as I noted earlier, Google’s search algorithm is not constrained by
      equal-time rules, it almost certainly ends up favoring one candidate over
      another in most political races, and that shifts opinions and votes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Search Suggestion Effect (SSE)</b><br>
      When Google first introduced autocomplete search suggestions—those short
      lists you see when you start to type an item into the Google search bar—it
      was supposedly meant to save you some time. Whatever the original
      rationale, those suggestions soon turned into a powerful means of
      manipulation that Google appears to use aggressively.<br>
      <br>
      My recent research suggests that (a) Google starts to manipulate your
      opinions from the very first character you type, and (b) by fiddling with
      the suggestions it shows you, Google can turn a 50–50 split among
      undecided voters into a 90–10 split with no one knowing. I call this
      manipulation the Search Suggestion Effect (SSE), and it is one of the most
      powerful behavioral manipulations I have ever seen in my nearly 40 years
      as a behavioral scientist.<br>
      <br>
      How will you know whether Google is messing with your election-related
      search suggestions in the weeks leading up to the election? You won’t.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. The Targeted Messaging Effect (TME)</b><br>
      If, on Nov. 8, 2016, Mr. Zuckerberg had sent go-out-and-vote reminders
      just to supporters of Mrs. Clinton, that would likely have given her an
      additional 450,000 votes. I’ve extrapolated that number from Facebook’s
      own published data.<br>
      <br>
      Because Zuckerberg was overconfident in 2016, I don’t believe he sent
      those messages, but he is surely not overconfident this time around. In
      fact, it’s possible that, at this very moment, Facebook and other
      companies are sending out targeted register-to-vote reminders, as well as
      targeted go-out-and-vote reminders in primary races. Targeted
      go-out-and-vote reminders might also favor one party on Election Day in
      November.<br>
      <br>
      My associates and I are building systems to monitor such things, but
      because no systems are currently in place, there is no sure way to tell
      whether Twitter, Google, and Facebook (or Facebook’s influential offshoot,
      Instagram) are currently tilting their messaging. No law or regulation
      specifically forbids the practice, and it would be an easy and economical
      way to serve company needs. Campaign donations cost money, after all, but
      tilting your messaging to favor one candidate is free.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Opinion Matching Effect (OME)</b><br>
      In March 2016, and continuing for more than seven months until Election
      Day, Tinder’s tens of millions of users could not only swipe to find sex
      partners, they could also swipe to find out whether they should vote for
      Trump or Clinton. The website iSideWith.com—founded and run by “two
      friends” with no obvious qualifications—claims to have helped more than 49
      million people match their opinions to the right candidate. Both CNN and
      USA Today have run similar services, currently inactive.<br>
      <br>
      I am still studying and quantifying this type of, um, helpful service, but
      so far it looks like (a) opinion matching services tend to attract
      undecided voters—precisely the kinds of voters who are most vulnerable to
      manipulation, and (b) they can easily produce opinion shifts of 30 percent
      or more without people’s awareness.<br>
      <br>
      At this writing, iSideWith is already helping people decide who they
      should vote for in the 2018 New York U.S. Senate race, the 2018 New York
      gubernatorial race, the 2018 race for New York District 10 of the U.S.
      House of Representatives, and, believe it or not, the 2020 presidential
      race. Keep your eyes open for other matching services as they turn up, and
      ask yourself this: Who wrote those algorithms, and how can we know whether
      they are biased toward one candidate or party?<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. Answer Bot Effect (ABE)</b><br>
      More and more these days, people don’t want lists of thousands of search
      results, they just want the answer, which is being supplied by personal
      assistants like Google Home devices, the Google Assistant on Android
      devices, Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and Google’s featured
      snippets—those answer boxesat the top of Google search results. I call the
      opinion shift produced by such mechanisms the Answer Bot Effect (ABE).<br>
      <br>
      My research on Google’s answer boxes shows three things so far: First,
      they reduce the time people spend searching for more information. Second,
      they reduce the number of times people click on search results. And third,
      they appear to shift opinions 10 to 30 percent more than search results
      alone do. I don’t yet know exactly how many votes can be shifted by answer
      bots, but in a national election in the United States, the number might be
      in the low millions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>6. Shadowbanning</b><br>
      Recently, Trump complained that Twitter was preventing conservatives from
      reaching many of their followers on that platform through shadowbanning,
      the practice of quietly hiding a user’s posts without the user knowing.
      The validity of Trump’s specific accusation is arguable, but the fact
      remains that any platform on which people have followers or friends can be
      rigged in a way to suppress the views and influence of certain individuals
      without people knowing the suppression is taking place. Unfortunately,
      without aggressive monitoring systems in place, it’s hard to know for sure
      when or even whether shadowbanning is occurring.<br>
      <br>
      <b>7. Programmed Virality and the Digital Bandwagon Effect</b><br>
      Big Tech companies would like us to believe that virality on platforms
      like YouTube or Instagram is a profoundly mysterious phenomenon, even
      while acknowledging that their platforms are populated by tens of millions
      of fake accounts that might affect virality.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, there is an obvious situation in which virality is not mysterious
      at all, and that is when the tech companies themselves decide to shift
      high volumes of traffic in ways that suit their needs. And aren’t they
      always doing this? Because Facebook’s algorithms are secret, if an
      executive decided to bestow instant Instagram stardom on a pro-Elizabeth
      Warren college student, we would have no way of knowing that this was a
      deliberate act and no way of countering it.<br>
      <br>
      The same can be said of the virality of YouTube videos and Twitter
      campaigns; they are inherently competitive—except when company employees
      or executives decide otherwise. Google has an especially powerful and
      subtle way of creating instant virality using a technique I’ve dubbed the
      Digital Bandwagon Effect. Because the popularity of websites drives them
      higher in search results, and because high-ranking search results increase
      the popularity of websites (SEME), Google has the ability to engineer a
      sudden explosion of interest in a candidate or cause with no one—perhaps
      even people at the companies themselves—having the slightest idea they’ve
      done so. In 2015, I published a mathematical model showing how neatly this
      can work.<br>
      <br>
      <b>8. The Facebook Effect</b><br>
      Because Facebook’s ineptness and dishonesty have squeezed it into a
      digital doghouse from which it might never emerge, it gets its own
      precinct on my list.<br>
      <br>
      In 2016, I published an article detailing five ways that Facebook could
      shift millions of votes without people knowing: biasing its trending box,
      biasing its center newsfeed, encouraging people to look for
      election-related material in its search bar (which it did that year!),
      sending out targeted register-to-vote reminders, and sending out targeted
      go-out-and-vote reminders.<br>
      <br>
      I wrote that article before the news stories broke about Facebook’s
      improper sharing of user data with multiple researchers and companies, not
      to mention the stories about how the company permitted fake news stories
      to proliferate on its platform during the critical days just before the
      November election—problems the company is now trying hard to mitigate.
      With the revelations mounting, on July 26, 2018, Facebook suffered the
      largest one-day drop in stock value of any company in history, and now
      it’s facing a shareholder lawsuit and multiple fines and investigations in
      both the United States and the EU.<br>
      <br>
      Facebook desperately needs new direction, which is why I recently called
      for Zuckerberg’s resignation. The company, in my view, could benefit from
      the new perspectives that often come with new leadership.<br>
      <br>
      <b>9. Censorship</b><br>
      I am cheating here by labeling one category “censorship,” because
      censorship—the selective and biased suppression of information—can be
      perpetrated in so many different ways.<br>
      <br>
      Shadowbanning could be considered a type of censorship, for example, and
      in 2016, a Facebook whistleblower claimed he had been on a company team
      that was systematically removing conservative news stories from Facebook’s
      newsfeed. Now, because of Facebook’s carelessness with user data, the
      company is openly taking pride in rapidly shutting down accounts that
      appear to be Russia-connected—even though company representatives
      sometimes acknowledge that they “don’t have all the facts.”<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, Zuckerberg has crowed about his magnanimity in preserving the
      accounts of people who deny the Holocaust, never mentioning the fact that
      provocative content propels traffic that might make him richer. How would
      you know whether Facebook was selectively suppressing material that
      favored one candidate or political party? You wouldn’t. (For a detailed
      look at nine ways Google censors content, see my essay “The New
      Censorship,” published in 2016.)<br>
      <br>
      <b>10. The Digital Customization Effect (DCE)</b><br>
      Any marketer can tell you how important it is to know your customer. Now,
      think about that simple idea in a world in which Google has likely
      collected the equivalent of millions of Word pages of information about
      you. If you randomly display a banner ad on a web page, out of 10,000
      people, only five are likely to click on it; that’s the CTR—the
      “clickthrough rate” (0.05 percent). But if you target your ad, displaying
      it only to people whose interests it matches, you can boost your CTR a
      hundredfold.<br>
      <br>
      That’s why Google, Facebook, and others have become increasingly obsessed
      with customizing the information they show you: They want you to be
      happily and mindlessly clicking away on the content they show you.<br>
      <br>
      In the research I conduct, my impact is always larger when I am able to
      customize information to suit people’s backgrounds. Because I know very
      little about the participants in my experiments, however, I am able to do
      so in only feeble ways, but the tech giants know everything about you—even
      things you don’t know about yourself. This tells me that the effect sizes
      I find in my experiments are probably too low. The impact that companies
      like Google are having on our lives is quite possibly much larger than I
      think it is. Perhaps that doesn’t scare you, but it sure scares me.<br>
      <br>
      The Same Direction<br>
      <br>
      OK, you say, so much for Epstein’s list! What about those other
      shenanigans we’ve heard about: voter fraud (Trump’s explanation for why he
      lost the popular vote), gerrymandering, rigged voting machines, targeted
      ads placed by Cambridge Analytica, votes cast over the internet, or, as I
      mentioned earlier, those millions of bots designed to shift opinions. What
      about hackers like Andrés Sepúlveda, who spent nearly a decade using
      computer technology to rig elections in Latin America? What about all the
      ways new technologies make dirty tricks easier in elections? And what
      about those darn Russians, anyway?<br>
      <br>
      To all that I say: kid stuff. Dirty tricks have been around since the
      first election was held millennia ago. But unlike the new manipulative
      tools controlled by Google and Facebook, the old tricks are
      competitive—it’s your hacker versus my hacker, your bots versus my bots,
      your fake news stories versus my fake news stories—and sometimes illegal,
      which is why Sepúlveda’s efforts failed many times and why Cambridge
      Analytica is dust.<br>
      <br>
      “Cyberwar,” a new book by political scientist Kathleen Hall Jamieson,
      reminds us that targeted ads and fake news stories can indeed shift votes,
      but the numbers are necessarily small. It’s hard to overwhelm your
      competitor when he or she can play the same games you are playing.<br>
      <br>
      Now, take a look at my numbered list. The techniques I’ve described can
      shift millions of votes without people’s awareness, and because they are
      controlled by the platforms themselves, they are entirely noncompetitive.
      If Google or Facebook or Twitter wants to shift votes, there is no way to
      counteract their manipulations. In fact, at this writing, there is not
      even a credible way of detecting those manipulations.<br>
      <br>
      And what if the tech giants are all leaning in the same political
      direction? What if the combined weight of their subtle and untraceable
      manipulative power favors one political party? If 150 million people vote
      this November in the United States, with 20 percent still undecided at
      this writing (that’s 30 million people), I estimate that the combined
      weight of Big Tech manipulations could easily shift upwards of 12 million
      votes without anyone knowing. That’s enough votes to determine the
      outcomes of hundreds of close local, state, and congressional races
      throughout the country, which makes the free-and-fair election little more
      than an illusion.<br>
      <br>
      Full disclosure: I happen to think that the political party currently in
      favor in Silicon Valley is, by a hair (so to speak), the superior party at
      the moment. But I also love America and democracy, and I believe that the
      free-and-fair election is the bedrock of our political system. I don’t
      care how “right” these companies might be; lofty ends do not justify shady
      means, especially when those means are difficult to see and not well
      understood by either authorities or the public.<br>
      <br>
      Can new regulations or laws save us from the extraordinary powers of
      manipulation the Big Tech companies now possess? Maybe, but our leaders
      seem to be especially regulation-shy these days, and I doubt, in any case,
      whether laws and regulations will ever be able to keep up with the new
      kinds of threats that new technologies will almost certainly pose in
      coming years.<br>
      <br>
      I don’t believe we are completely helpless, however. I think that one way
      to turn Facebook, Google, and the innovative technology companies that
      will succeed them, into responsible citizens is to set upsophisticated
      monitoring systems that detect, analyze, and archive what they’re showing
      people—in effect, to fight technology with technology.<br>
      <br>
      As I mentioned earlier, in 2016, I led a team that monitored search
      results on multiple search engines. That was a start, but we can do much
      better. These days, I’m working with business associates and academic
      colleagues on three continents to scale up systems to monitor a wide range
      of information the Big Tech companies are sharing with their users—even
      the spoken answers provided by personal assistants. Ultimately, a
      worldwide ecology of passive monitoring systems will make these companies
      accountable to the public, with information bias and online manipulation
      detectable in real time.<br>
      <br>
      With November drawing near, there is obviously some urgency here. At this
      writing, it’s not clear whether we will be fully operational in time to
      monitor the midterm elections, but we’re determined to be ready for 2020.<br>

      Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology in California.<br>

      The citizens demanded an FTC task force and they got one launched: The
      Federal Trade Commission will be launching a task force to monitor
      competition in the US’s technology markets, FTC commissioners announced.<br>
      <br>
      The task force will include current officials working in the agency’s
      Bureau of Competition in order to “enhance the Bureau’s focus on
      technology-related sectors of the economy, including markets in which
      online platforms compete.” It will also include 17 staff attorneys who
      will be tasked with investigating anti-competitive behavior in the tech
      industry.<br>
      <br>
      “The role of technology in the economy and in our lives grows more
      important every day,” FTC Chairman Joe Simons said. “As I’ve noted in the
      past, it makes sense for us to closely examine technology markets to
      ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition.”<br>
      <br>
      “Technology markets ... raise distinct challenges for antitrust
      enforcement”<br>
      <br>
      The new task force comes amid growing pressure for antitrust action
      against large tech companies like Facebook and Google. Earlier this month,
      it was reported that FTC officials have been looking to levy a
      multibillion-dollar fine on Facebook for repeatedly violating a privacy
      agreement the two bodies came to back in 2011. A coalition of advocacy
      groups argued that a fine would not be enough to incentivize Facebook to
      be more cautious with consumer data and asked the FTC to force the company
      spinoffs, Instagram and WhatsApp, back into their own entities once again.
      The groups argued that Facebook was too big for it to adequately care for
      user data for all three major apps.<br>

      Discussion over retroactive merger reviews that may result in companies
      divesting previously approved assets has been heating up over the last few
      months. The Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee has been reportedly
      beefing up its antitrust arm and hiring on big names like Lina Khan in the
      academic sphere.<br>
      <br>
      “Technology markets, which are rapidly evolving and touch so many other
      sectors of the economy, raise distinct challenges for antitrust
      enforcement,” said Bureau Director Bruce Hoffman. “By centralizing our
      expertise and attention, the new task force will be able to focus on these
      markets exclusively – ensuring they are operating pursuant to the
      antitrust laws, and taking action where they are not.”<br>
      <br>
      Hoffman confirmed that the task force would look into consummated mergers,
      but could not name any investigations specifically. When it comes to
      remedies for problematic mergers, Hoffman said that firms could be “broken
      out,” or could be forced to “spin off” previous acquisitions as new
      competitors in order to recreate the markets pre-merger.<br>
      <br>
      Hoffman said that the task force would be working closely with the FTC’s
      Consumer Protection Bureau as it relates to consumer privacy enforcement
      especially in cases in which these issues coalesce.<br>
      <br>
      “Our ongoing Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st
      Century are a crucial step to deepen our understanding of these markets
      and potential competitive issues. The Technology Task Force is the next
      step in that effort,” Simons said in the press release.<br>
      <br>
      The Justice Department, which also has antitrust jurisdiction, is aware of
      the FTC’s new task force, according to Hoffman, and both agencies will
      continue to work separately on this front.<br>
      <br>
      An alliance of investigators, forensics experts, EU prosecution offices,
      FBI specialists, journalists, voters and public crowd-sourced volunteers

      these crimes and reprisal attacks on those who reported them. <br>
